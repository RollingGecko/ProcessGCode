Monkey around with GCode (especially from KISSlicer) written by Lars Norpchen,

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i filename, --input filename
                        specify the input file to process
  -o filename, --output filename
                        specify the output file to generate
  -s, --strip           Strip redundant move command parameters. Saves a
                        little space, should not change the result, in
                        theory... use at your own risk!
  -d mm, --decimate mm  Drop XY movements smaller than this. Useful to get rid
                        of excessive "micromoves" that are below the printer's
                        resolution. Requires "--strip" option enabled to work
  -u original replacement, --replace original replacement
                        Replace a code with another code. Regex coding is
                        supported (^ for beginning of line, etc). Can be used
                        to comment out codes by adding a ";" to the code.
  -f multiplier, --fan multiplier
                        Multiply all fan speeds by this. This only affects fan
                        speeds that were in the original file, not those fan
                        speed commands added by options in this script
  -t multiplier, --temperature multiplier
                        Multiply all extruder temperatures by this.
  -j degrees, --minimum-temperature degrees
                        Enforce a minimum temperature for all extruder
                        temperature settings (including raft cooling). Will
                        not override extruder off (temp=0) commands.
  -n degrees, --maximum-temperature degrees
                        Enforce a maximum temperature for all extruder
                        temperature settings
  -b multiplier, --bed multiplier
                        Multiply all bed temps by this
  -k degrees layer, --cool-bed degrees layer
                        KISSlicer only. Decrease the bed temperature by
                        DEGREES at specified LAYER
  -q fan_speed, --cool-support fan_speed
                        KISSlicer only. Turns the fan on for all "Support
                        Interface" paths. Fan speed is 0 - 255.
  -g fan_speed, --cool-sparse-infill fan_speed
                        KISSlicer only. Turns the fan on for all "Sparse
                        Infill" paths. Fan speed is 0 - 255.
  -w fan_speed temperaturedrop, --cool-raft fan_speed temperaturedrop
                        KISSlicer only. Adjusts the fan and extrusion
                        temperature to make it easier to remove the raft. Set
                        the fan speed (0-255) and temperature reduction (in
                        degrees) for first object layer
  -x mm, --xoffset mm   Offset all X movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -y mm, --yoffset mm   Offset all Y movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -z mm, --zoffset mm   Offset all Z movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -r multiplier, --feedrate multiplier
                        Multiply all movement rates by this (X, Y, Z and
                        Extruder)
  -e multiplier, --extrusion-flow multiplier
                        Multiply extrusion amount by this.
  -m, --move-header     KISSlicer only. Moves the slicing summary at the end
                        of the file to the head of the file
  -p, --print-layer     KISSlicer only. Print the current layer number on the
                        LCD display
  -v, --verbose         KISSlicer only. Show movement type comments on the LCD
                        display. This command can be risky on some machines
                        because it adds a lot of extra chatter to the user
                        interface and may cause problems during printing.
  --report-flow         Report extrusion vs travel rate (micrometers of
                        filament per mm of travel)
  -l LCD_COMMAND, --LCD-command LCD_COMMAND
                        Set the G-Code M command for showing a message on the
                        device display. M117 for Marlin, M70 for ReplicatorG
                        (default)
  -c, --colored-movements
                        KISSlicer only. Set RGB LED to show the KISSlicer path
                        type using the M420 command (Makerbot). This command
                        can be risky on some machines because it adds a lot of
                        extra chatter to the user interface and may cause
                        problems during printing.
  --quote-messages      LCD display commands will wrap quotes around the
                        message
  --no-header           Remove the header (all commands before the first layer
                        command)
  --resume line         Resume an interrupted print from a given line number.
                        X and Y position will be set for you, but you need to
                        manually position the printer's Z height before
                        resuming. Line number is in the input file, which may
                        change position in the output file based on other post
                        processing commands.
  --movement abs or rel
                        Output all movement to use absolute or relative mode.
  --comments pad or remove
                        Pad or remove comments from gcode file. Pad adds an
                        empty move command to the start of comment only lines.
                        Most hosts will not send comments to printer, however
                        this can cause a line number mismatch between the
                        original file and the printed file (which makes it
                        harder to resume).
  --wait-temp none, first, or all
                        Wait for extruder temperature changes
  --split filename (layer, zheight, nth, or path) value
                        Split the file into a second file based on layer,
                        height or path type.
  --inject filename (layer, zheight, nth, or path) value
                        Insert the file snippet based on layer, height or path
                        type.
  --retract distance speed threshold
                        Retract the filament a given number of mm for non-
                        extrusion moves greater than the threshold (in mm).
                        Retraction speed is in F code feedrate (mm/min)
  --wait-bed-temp none, first, or all
                        Wait for bed temperature changes
  --version             show program's version number and exit
