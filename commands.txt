Monkey around with GCode (especially from KISSlicer, Slic3r support not
thoroughly tested) written by Lars Norpchen, http://www.octopusmotor.com

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u original replacement, --replace original replacement
                        Replace a code with another code. Regex coding is
                        supported (^ for beginning of line, etc). Can be used
                        to comment out codes by adding a ";" to the code.
  --version             show program's version number and exit

File input and output options:
  -i filename, --input filename
                        specify the input file to process
  -o filename, --output filename
                        specify the output file to generate. If not specified,
                        output will overwrite the input file when done.
  --split filename (layer, zheight, nth, or path) value
                        Split the file into a second file based on layer,
                        height or path type.
  --inject filename (layer, zheight, nth, or path) value
                        Insert the file snippet based on layer, height or path
                        type. MUST use relative E coordindates and disable
                        destringing in slicer
  --merge filename [additional files ...]
                        Merge the specified file(s). They will be interleaved
                        by layer, sorted based on Z height. MUST use relative
                        E coordindates and disable destringing in slicer app
                        (you can add retraction commands using the --retract
                        option)
  --resume line, layer, or Zheight value
                        Resume an interrupted print from a given line, layer
                        or ZHeight. X and Y position will be set for you, but
                        you need to manually position the printer's Z height
                        before resuming. Line number is based on the input
                        file, which may change position in the output file
                        based on other post processing commands.

Fan and Temperature control options:
  -f multiplier, --fan multiplier
                        Multiply all fan speeds by this. This only affects fan
                        speeds that were in the original file, not those fan
                        speed commands added by options in this script
  -t multiplier, --temperature multiplier
                        Multiply all extruder temperatures by this.
  -j degrees, --minimum-temperature degrees
                        Enforce a minimum temperature for all extruder
                        temperature settings (including raft cooling). Will
                        not override extruder off (temp=0) commands.
  -n degrees, --maximum-temperature degrees
                        Enforce a maximum temperature for all extruder
                        temperature settings
  --wait-temp none, first, or all
                        Wait for extruder temperature changes
  --wait-bed-temp none, first, or all
                        Wait for bed temperature changes
  -b multiplier, --bed multiplier
                        Multiply all bed temps by this
  -k degrees layer, --cool-bed degrees layer
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Decrease the bed temperature
                        by DEGREES at specified LAYER
  -q fan_speed, --cool-support fan_speed
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Turns the fan on for all
                        "Support Interface" paths. Fan speed is 0 - 255.
  -g fan_speed, --cool-sparse-infill fan_speed
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Turns the fan on for all
                        "Sparse Infill" paths. Fan speed is 0 - 255.
  -w fan_speed temperaturedrop, --cool-raft fan_speed temperaturedrop
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Adjusts the fan and extrusion
                        temperature to make it easier to remove the raft. Set
                        the fan speed (0-255) and temperature reduction (in
                        degrees) for first object layer

Movement control options:
  --quality quality_setting [quality_setting ...]
                        Adjust the print quality for a given key (path / layer
                        / etc. -- only path is supported at the moment).
                        Scales speed, acceleration and jerk values for each
                        extrusion move -- for example 1.0 is normal, 2.0 is
                        half speed and 0.5 is double speed. This requires
                        printer firmware support for the Q field in the G0/G1
                        commands. Multiple quality options can be set, with
                        each of the three required settings for each option
                        being comma separated (ie: --quality 2,0,path,loop
                        3.0,path,skirt 0.2,path,perimeter ) .
  -d mm, --decimate mm  Drop XY movements smaller than this. Useful to get rid
                        of excessive "micromoves" that are below the printer's
                        resolution. Requires "--strip" option enabled to work
  --movement abs or rel
                        Convert / output all movement to use absolute or
                        relative mode.
  --scalex x            Scale all X movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  --scaley x            Scale all Y movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  --scalez x            Scale all Z movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  --scaleall x          Scale all X, Y and Z movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  -x mm, --xoffset mm   Offset all X movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -y mm, --yoffset mm   Offset all Y movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -z mm, --zoffset mm   Offset all Z movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -r multiplier, --feedrate multiplier
                        Multiply all movement rates by this (X, Y, Z and
                        Extruder)
  -e multiplier, --extrusion-flow multiplier
                        Multiply extrusion amount by this.
  --retract distance speed threshold
                        Retract the filament a given number of mm for non-
                        extrusion moves greater than the threshold (in mm).
                        Retraction speed is in F code feedrate (mm/min)
  --explicit            Force all coordinates to be listed in all G0/G1
                        commands
  -s, --strip           Strip redundant move command parameters. Saves a
                        little space, should not change the result, in
                        theory... use at your own risk!

Printer user interface options:
  -p, --print-layer     Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Print the current layer
                        number on the LCD display
  -v, --verbose         Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Show movement type comments
                        on the LCD display. This command can be risky on some
                        machines because it adds a lot of extra chatter to the
                        user interface and may cause problems during printing.
  -l LCD_COMMAND, --LCD-command LCD_COMMAND
                        Set the G-Code M command for showing a message on the
                        device display. M117 for Marlin, M70 for ReplicatorG
                        (default)
  --progress GCode_header lines
                        Output progress percentage (based on input file lines)
                        every N lines with the given GCode prefix / header
                        (ie: M73 Q). Will not give proper values if you merge
                        or insert or split files in the same pass.
  -c, --colored-movements
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Set RGB LED to show the path
                        type using the M420 command (Makerbot). This command
                        can be risky on some machines because it adds a lot of
                        extra chatter to the user interface and may cause
                        problems during printing.
  --quote-messages      LCD display commands will wrap quotes around the
                        message

GCode comments options:
  --comments pad or remove
                        Pad or remove comments from gcode file. Pad adds an
                        empty move command to the start of comment only lines.
                        Most hosts will not send comments to printer, however
                        this can cause a line number mismatch between the
                        original file and the printed file (which makes it
                        harder to resume).
  --no-header           Remove the header (all commands before the first layer
                        command)
  -m, --move-header     KISSlicer only. Moves the slicing summary at the end
                        of the file to the head of the file
  --description         Add metrics data to the system DESCRIPT.ION file for
                        the output file
  --metrics             Add comments with metrics data to end of the output
                        file
  --report-flow         Report extrusion vs travel rate (micrometers of
                        filament per mm of travel)
